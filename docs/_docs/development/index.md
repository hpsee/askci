# Development

This set of instructions is intended for local development. If you want to deploy to
a server, see the [production pages]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/production).

First, clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/hpsee/askci
cd askci
```

## Start Development Server

Take a look at the client usage first:

```bash
$ ./askci.sh 
.=----------------------------------------------=.
|                  AskCI CLI                     |
|             Available Instructions             |
.=----------------------------------------------=.

dev
  Starts development containers.

prod
  Starts production stack.

stop <prod|dev>
  Stops containers.

up <prod|dev>
  Restart containers.

restart <prod|dev>
  View logs.

logs <prod|dev>
  Just brings up the containers. no building.

rm <prod|dev>
  Remove containers.

uninstall
  Removes all the content and containers related to AskCI.
```

Then you can use a single command to bring up a development server.

```bash
./askci.sh dev
```

For development, the default is expose port 80, and use localhost. Here is an example of
responding to the prompts for the first time:

```bash
$ ./askci.sh dev
.=----------------------------------------------=.
|                  AskCI CLI                     |
|   Welcome to the setup process for AskCI!      |
|      This won't take more than a minute.       |
.=----------------------------------------------=.

Asking for host details :->

Enter your host IP address (e.g. 173.194.122.231): 127.0.0.1
Do you confirm 127.0.0.1 for your host IP address? [y|n] y

Enter your host domain name (e.g. google.com): localhost
Do you confirm localhost for your host domain name? [y|n] y

.=----------------------------------------------=.
|                  AskCI CLI                     |
|   Welcome to the setup process for AskCI!      |
|      This won't take more than a minute.       |
.=----------------------------------------------=.

Asking for server details:->

Enter your host IP address (e.g. 173.194.122.231): 34.83.45.68
Do you confirm 34.83.45.68 for your host IP address? [y|n] y

Enter your host domain name (e.g. google.com): askci.dev
Do you confirm askci.dev for your host domain name? [y|n] y

Enter a help contact email for your server (e.g., name@institution.edu): vsochat@stanford.edu
Do you confirm vsochat@stanford.edu for a help contact email for your server? [y|n] y

Enter an institutional help or support site (e.g., https://srcc.stanford.edu): https://github.com/vsoch/askci/issues
Do you confirm https://github.com/vsoch/askci/issues for an institutional help or support site? [y|n] y

Enter your institution or affiliation  (e.g., Stanford University): Stanford University
Do you confirm Stanford University for your institution or affiliation ? [y|n] y

Enter a lowercase (no spaces) unique resource identifier for the server  (e.g., askci-server): askci-server
Do you confirm askci-dev for a lowercase (no spaces) unique resource identifier for the server ? [y|n] y  

Enter the name of the server  (e.g., AskCI): AskCI
Do you confirm AskCI for the name of the server ? [y|n] y

Enter a Twitter account  (e.g., askcyberinfra): askcyberinfra
Do you confirm askcyberinfra for a Twitter account ? [y|n] y

Generating a secret for you... done âœ” 
>>> (We'are all set and ready to go.) <<<
```

Finally, after you run this command the first time, your settings
are saved in an `.env` file. To regenerate, either delete the file and 
run again, or edit the file directly.

## Containers

The development setup is simple - one container runs a development server,
and the second builds and updates the backend (e.g., collecting static and
making migrations).

 - askci-dev_base: handles collecting static and migrations, and then exists
 - askci-dev_worker: is a task worker
 - askci-dev_scheduler and askci-dev_worker handle scheduled tasks
 - askci-dev_nginx is the web server
 - askci-dev_redis is a redis database for scheduled tasks

## Commands

Restart the containers:

```bash
$ ./askci.sh restart dev
```

View logs

```bash
$ ./askci.sh logs dev
$ ./askci.sh logs dev askci-dev_base
```

Stop containers:

```bash
./askci.sh stop dev
```

To remove the images:

```bash
./askci.sh rm dev
```

You can also easily use docker-compose directly, which will work from any subfolder:

```bash
docker-compose restart uwsgi
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm
```

or use the Makefile to run the linted (required [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)). It skips over migration
folders.

```bash
make lint
```

## Custom Build

The docker-compose will build the container automatically,
but if you want to build manually (such as without using cache) you can
do
```bash
docker build --no-cache -t askci_dev_image .
```

If you change anything in the `requirements.txt` file you'll likely need to do this.

## Web Interface

Now open web browser to your host address to see AskCI. NGINX logs will appear in nginx/logs and gunicorn logs in run/logs.<br>
This process will also create a superuser with
```
    username: admin
    password: lukedidntknow
```
credentials, if there's not any. Keep in mind to change/remove this and create another one in Django admin panel.

Before starting your server, you should next look at options for [plugins]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/plugins/).
