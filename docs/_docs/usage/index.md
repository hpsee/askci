# Usage

## Creating an Article

If you have connected with GitHub (regular, not read only) you will have authenticated
with the correct permissions to read organizations, create webhooks, and create repositories.
In this case, you should be able to click "New Article" and input the term name 
and repository to continue.

### What if I don't see my organization?

If your organization doesn't show up, it's usually because of [this issue](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-API-Development-and/list-orgs-returning-empty/td-p/39344):

 - your membership is private (make it public!)
 - when you authenticated, you didn't add it to have permission
 - you can check under the organization -> Settings -> Third party access

For the above, you can go under the AskCI application in your user settings
and grant the access after the fact, if you have permission to do so. If you don't,
you'll need to contact an organization owner/admin.
