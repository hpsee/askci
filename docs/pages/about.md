# About

This is a documentation base (under development) for the AskCI server and API.
See the [respository]({{ site.repo }}) for more details.


## Background

I invisioned creating a shared documentation server back in 2017, something I called "The Documentation Octopus" since it would span multiple universities. 
I started to work on a [server](https://www.github.com/researchapps/helpme-server) that users could submit help requests to, but realized that a much more extendable tool would be to provide a client that can submit help requests to already existing servers. 
That project turned into [helpme](https://www.github.com/vsoch/helpme) and the server was largely abandoned. 
I joined the [AskCI](https://ask.ci) community at the end of 2018, and while we use a Discourse installation, it still feels like many elements are missing. 
Since I can make some time, I figured I'd give this another go.
